<p>JS-Bonsai is a vanilla JavaScript port of the popular cbonsai terminal program, bringing the mesmerizing art of procedurally generated ASCII bonsai trees to the web browser. Built with pure JavaScript and requiring no external dependencies, this project demonstrates how complex visual algorithms can be reimagined for web-based environments while maintaining the charm and character of the original terminal-based inspiration.</p>

<p>The project features a sophisticated growth animation system that allows users to watch as their unique bonsai tree takes shape, branch by branch and leaf by leaf. Each tree is generated using carefully tuned parameters that control various aspects of the tree's appearance, including branch density, leaf characters, and overall size. The implementation includes options for live animation, infinite generation mode, and even a screensaver feature that continuously produces new trees, making it both a practical tool for web developers and an engaging visual element for any website.</p>

<p>What sets JS-Bonsai apart is its commitment to customization and interactivity. Users can fine-tune their bonsai trees using a variety of parameters, from selecting custom characters for leaves to adjusting the branch multiplier and life values that influence the tree's growth patterns. The project also includes features like message attachment and deterministic generation through seed values, making it possible to recreate specific tree designs or integrate personalized messages alongside the ASCII artwork.</p>
